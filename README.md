####  🙋‍♂️  This is `dxps` area, meaning my software development experiences.

<br/>
A summary about myself, while wearing solution architect and developer hats:
<br/><br/>

- Thinking in Go and Rust programming languages, and Distributed Systems architectures.
- Big fan of Clean Architecture and Event Driven Architectures.
- Still evaluating Rust and Zig.
- Used to love Java and (most of) its ecosystem.
- Used to implement solutions and deliver trainings on (mainly IBM) HA clustering technologies.

And some GitHub stats:
