A summary about myself, while wearing solution architect and developer hats:
<br/>
- Loving Golang, and Distributed Systems.
- Rust enthusiast.
- Big fan of Clean and Event Driven Architectures.
- Used to love Java and (most of) its ecosystem. Not anymore.

I had very satisfying results implementing middleware and highly available clustering solutions, and delivering trainings on some of the IBM products, including its great AIX (UNIX based) operating system. More details can be found on [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-ileana/).
