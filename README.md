#### Hello world! 🙋‍♂️ This is mainly my software development experiences (dxps) space.

<br/>
A summary about myself, while wearing solution architect and developer hats:
<br/><br/>

- Nowadays, thinking in (and kinda obsessed with) Rust programming language.
- Still liking Golang, and Distributed Systems as a generic architecture.
- Big fan of Clean Architecture and Event Driven Architectures.
- Used to love Java and (most of) its ecosystem. Not anymore.

I had very satisfying results implementing middleware and high available clustering solutions and delivering trainings on IBM products and its great AIX operating system. For further details, checkout my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-ileana/).
