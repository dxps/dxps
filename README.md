####  🙋‍♂️  This is `dxps` area, meaning my development experiences.

<br/>
A summary about myself, while wearing both solution architect and developer hats:
<br/><br/>

- Thinking in V, Go, Rust, and Distributed Systems nowadays.
- Big fan of V lang, Clean and Event Driven Architectures.
- Used to love Java and (most of) its ecosystem.
- Used to implement and deliver trainings on (mainly IBM) clustering technologies.

And some GitHub stats:
